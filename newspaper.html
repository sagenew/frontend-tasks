                <p>A Florida man was arrested on Sunday after he stole an ambulance but got it stuck in mud a few miles away.
                According to a press release from the Hernando County Sheriff's Office in Florida, on Sunday, authorities responded to a call of a stolen ambulance near the area of Port Court in Spring Hill.</p>
                <p>The ambulance was left unsupervised while parked in the ambulance bay as the operating crew was in the process of transporting a patient from the ambulance to inside the hospital.
                The suspect who allegedly stole the ambulance was identified by the Hernando County Sheriff's Office as 29-year-old Trey Cornwell.</p>

                <p>According to the release, after Cornwell allegedly stole the ambulance from the Oak Hill Hospital's ambulance bay, he drove it a few miles away to the "Kass Circle area off of Port Court."
                As Cornwell continued to drive the stolen ambulance, he eventually approached a "a nearby body of water off of Port Court," 
                where the ambulance got stuck in mud and sand, according to the release. </p>
                In the release, which was posted to Facebook, police also included several pictures of the ambulance where it can be seen stuck in the mud and sand.

                <p>STUART, FLA. — A Florida man who thought he heard an intruder outside his bedroom door instead fatally shot his pregnant wife, sheriff’s officials said.
                The shooting happened just around 1:30 a.m. Wednesday when the woman’s husband heard a noise outside the bedroom door of their home in Stuart, Martin County Sheriff William Snyder told news outlets.
                The man told detectives he didn’t realize his wife was not in the room. He frantically called 911 and told dispatchers he had accidentally shot his wife, Snyder said.
                The woman was taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead.</p>
                <p>“He gave us a pretty in depth statement, in which he said that he awoke in the middle of the night, thought he heard somebody in the house, went to investigate with a handgun, saw a shape in the hallway and fired one round and unfortunately, it turned out to be his wife,” Snyder said.
                The woman was six months pregnant, and doctors were able to save the baby, WPBF reported.</p>

                <p>Deputies said a 2-year-old child was in the home when the shooting happened. The agency cited Marsy’s Law in not releasing the names of the woman or her husband. The law, approved by voters, was designed to protect victims of crime.
                “This is a nightmare case,” Snyder said. “You know somebody who thinks he’s defending his home, actually shoots his wife.”
                The agency is conducting an investigation.</p>

                <p>The suspect, 26-year-old James Blight, told officers he was too drunk at the time to remember what happened.</p>
                <p>HAINES CITY, Fla. (AP) — A 26-year-old man has been accused of stealing a bulldozer from a Florida construction site, driving it into a neighborhood and knocking down campaign signs for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, according to authorities and homeowners. </p>
                <p>The man took the bulldozer in Haines City on Saturday and repeatedly destroyed Biden signs in full view of people who live in the neighborhood, witnesses said. James Blight was charged with grand theft auto and trespassing, according to the Haines City Police Department. 
                Former Vice Mayor Adam Burgess lives in the central Florida neighborhood, which he said is predominantly Black. He called it a hate crime.</p>
                <span class="citation">“This man came onto my property, took the two Joe Biden signs I had in my yard and then came back with a bulldozer to run down my fence,” Burgess told Bay News 9.</span>
                <p>Video taken by the news outlet showed the damaged fences. Blight was also accused of bulldozing down a city speed limit sign, among other signs. 
                Police said Blight claimed he was too drunk at the time to remember what happened. It was not immediately clear whether he has an attorney who could comment on his behalf.</p>

                        Some of your job responsibilities are too much for one person and they might weigh you down today, Aries. The pile of work seems to get steadily bigger no matter what you do. Delegate if you can. Put the least urgent tasks aside and work your way steadily the rest. Your employer may or may not expect too much of you, but you're entitled to your sanity no matter what.

                        A sudden fascination with metaphysical or spiritual concepts could have you wanting to read as much as you can on the subject, Taurus. Your enthusiasm could lead you in a dozen different directions, which could eventually lead to mental overload. It might be a better idea to take one subject at a time than try to learn about them all at once. Stay focused!

                        A business enterprise with a friend might seem a little shaky today, Gemini. You could alternate between enthusiasm and gloom regarding this project. It's probably a good one and could lead to the success you want. Don't make any negative judgments about its future based on what happens today. All should be progressing again within a few days.

                        A business deal that you may have been working to finish could require you to tie up a lot of loose ends today, Cancer. You might be pulled in a lot of different directions. Don't panic! Get some help if you can. Make a list of what you have to do and cross each task off as it's completed. Stay focused and all should go well. You will achieve the results you want.

                        Accomplishing some important business might require touching base with many people who live and work far away, perhaps in other countries. This might require that you spend a lot of time on the phone, and it also would require allowing for the different time zones, which could be a drag. You will eventually make the contacts you need, even if they don't come until tomorrow.

                        If you've been thinking about investing, Virgo, this isn't the day to commit to anything. This is a great day to consider your options, study economic trends, and analyze what you want from investing. It isn't a good day to hand over the money. Land could be a strong possibility. Consult with professionals, read the papers, and look into all kinds of opportunities before committing to one.

                        Working at home could be difficult today, especially if you're finalizing a business deal, Libra. Other household members will be coming and going, slamming doors, asking questions, bringing their friends in. If you're doing household chores, forget it for now and return to it when it's quieter. If you're approaching a deadline, close the door and tell others to leave you alone for a while.

                        Today you might feel the urge to get all unfinished work done, Scorpio. You could suddenly be in a frenzy to work quickly but perhaps not as conscientiously as you should. You may spend a lot of time going through paperwork and discarding what's outdated. It might be a better idea to slow down a little and look closely at what you're doing. You won't want to throw out something you may need later.

You will need information and materials you don't have at home, and finding them might require a larger expenditure of time, energy, and money than you initially thought. Don't give up on the idea. It's likely to be a good one and you will definitely want to pursue it.

                        Too many people may be vying for your attention today, Capricorn, both at work and home. You will want to make them all happy, so you may feel a little frazzled. Your temper might also be on edge. It would be better to put off the less urgent demands than work yourself into a frenzy. Those who matter would rather have you enjoy life than tire yourself out for their sake.

At first you will be excited by the mailbox full of letters, but then you'll find that some are junk while others are addressed to people you've never heard of. Hang in there. This tendency should pass by tomorrow

                        A friend may ask to borrow some money today, Pisces. You may feel that he or she is asking for more than is really needed, and certainly more than you're willing to give. You might think this puts you in an awkward position. Try to talk to your friend and explain your situation. If you have to say no, just say it. A real friend will understand and look elsewhere for the money.
